Code Sample

While I currently do not have a comprehensive code sample in R, Python, or Stata to share, my engagement with these languages is ongoing and practical. Presently, I serve as a course assistant at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), where I guide first-year graduate students in utilizing R for various projects. This role has allowed me to deepen my understanding and application of R in an academic setting, sharpening my skills through teaching and problem-solving. 

In light of this, I am sharing a short code sample from a recent statistics problem set that I helped pre-test, as well as a simple exercise on merging tables using Python.

In addition to code sample, I am sharing a recent mini-project that showcases my proficiency in data visualization using Tableau. This project was completed independently and demonstrates my ability to translate complex datasets into clear, insightful visual stories. You can view the visualization here: [Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oranda.hou/viz/FinalProj_Oranda/Dashboard1). This visualization served to make a point in the interactive story map article, which was a team effort to blend data analysis with narrative to produce engaging and informative content. The complete project can be explored here:[How Tenure Affects Political Polarization in the US Congress](https://storymaps.com/stories/848c796992f1457baeb41e364bc86778). 

Thank you for your consideration. Please feel free to let me know if thereâ€™s any question.
